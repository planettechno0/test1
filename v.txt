please welcome Nvidia founder and CEO
Jensen
Hong hello
Mumbai wow it's so great to be here
India very very dear to the world's
computer industry Central to the IT
industry at the center at the core of
the it of just about every single
company in the world let me thank all of
our partners our incredible partners
that we're working with here in India to
transform the IT industry together and
so I'm delighted that all of you have
joined us today there are two
fundamental shifts that are happening at
the same time in
1964 the IBM system
360
introduced the world to the concept of
it the IT industry as we know it
introduced the idea of general purpose
Computing for the last 30 years we've
had the benefit of mors law an
incredible
phenomenon without changing the
software the hardware can continue to
improve in an architecturally compatible
way and the benefits of that software
doubles every year Mo's law made it
possible for us to continue to drive
down cost democratize
Computing as we know it today but we
know now that the scaling of CPUs has
reached its limit we can't continue to
ride that curve that that Free Ride The
Free Ride of Moors law has ended we have
to now do something different we started
our company to accelerate software our
vision was there are applications that
would benefit from acceleration if we
augmented general purpose Computing we
take the workload that is very computer
intensive and we offload it and we
accelerate it using a model we call Cuda
a programming model that we invented C
Cuda that made it possible for us to
accelerate applications tremendously
real-time computer Graphics was made
possible because of Nvidia coming into
the world and make possible this new
processor we call gpus the GPU was
really the first accelerated
Computing architecture running Cuda
running computer Graphics a perfect
example we democratized computer
Graphics as we know it 3D Graphics is
now literally everywhere and so over the
last 30 years we've been on a journey to
accelerate one domain of application
after another today we accelerate so
many important industries ktho is
fundamental to semiconductor
manufacturing computational lithography
simulation computer Aid and Engineering
even 5G radio that we've recently
announced Partnerships with that we can
accelerate the 5G software stack Quantum
Computing so that we can invent the
future of computing with classical
Quantum hybrid Computing parabricks are
Gene sequencing software stack CVS one
of the most important things every
single company's working on is going
from databases to knowledge bases so
that we can create AI databases using
qvs that we create and vectorize all of
your data these acceleration libraries
Now cover so many different domains that
it
appears that accelerated
Computing is used everywhere but that's
simply because we've applied this
architecture one domain after another
domain that we've covered just about
every single industry now accelerated
Computing or Cuda has reached the
Tipping Point every single time I've
come to India I've had the benefit of
talking to you about deep learning had
the benefit of talking to you about
machine learning and I think it's very
very clear
now the world has completely
changed the first thing that happened of
course is how we do software our
industry is underpinned by the method by
which software is done the computer
model that we understood quite well and
it of course created one one of the
largest Industries in the world right
here in India the production of
software coding programming became a
whole industry however that approach of
developing software has been
disrupted it is now not
coding but machine
learning this way of doing
software notice is based on
fundamentally machine learning and we
have gone from coding to machine
learning from developing
software to creating artificial
intelligence and from software that
prefers to run on CPUs to now neural
networks that runs best on gpus this at
its core is what happened to our
industry in the last 10 years we
dedicated ourselves to advance this
field and so this is what we now build
this is what a GPU looks like today this
is
Blackwell incredible system that is
designed to study data at an enormous
scale we have now learned the meaning of
so many different types of data we have
learned to represent how to
represent information in so many
different modalities not only have we
learned the meaning of it we can
translate it to another modality so one
great example of course is translating
English to Hindi
translating
English large body of text into other
English summarization from pixels to
image image
recognition from words to pixels image
generation from
images videos to words
captioning from
words to
proteins used for drug Discovery from
words to chemicals discovering new
compounds from amino acids to proteins
understanding the structure of proteins
in the last couple two three years the
number of generative AI companies around
the world tens of
thousands tens of billions of dollars
have been invested in this field all
because of this one instrument that made
it possible for us to study data at
enormous scales in order to build the
Blackwell system of course the Blackwell
gpus is involved but it takes seven
other
chips
tsmc manufacture all of these chips and
they're just doing an extraordinary job
ramping the Blackwell system this is in
a all Blackwell is in full production
and we're hoping to uh we're expecting
to deliver in volume production in Q4
this is MV
link and it goes across the entire back
spine of a rack of gpus and these gpus
are all connected from the top to the
bottom using MV link driving these
incredible CIS the world's longest
driving CIS for copper and it connects
uh all of these gpus together 72 dual
GPU packages of black Wes 144 gpus
connected together so it's one giant GPU
this is connected to this
switch and this is one of the most
advanced switches the world's ever built
now all of this together represents
Blackwell and then it runs the software
uh that's on Top This is what Nvidia
builds today those of you who have known
us for a very long time it's really
quite surprising how the company has
transformed but literally we reason from
first principles how Computing was going
to be done in the fure future and this
is Blackwell and what we're trying to do
is to learn larger and smarter models
it's called the scaling law the scaling
law comes from the fact that the
observation that the empirical
observation and measurements that
suggests the more data you have to train
a large language model with and
therefore the correspondingly
large model size you know the more
information you want to learn from
the larger the model has to be or the
larger model you would like to train the
more data you need to have the second
thing that we've discovered recently and
this is a very big deal after you're
done training the model you give it a
prompt and the AI process through a very
large neural network and produces a
sequence of answers in the future and
starting with strawberry we realize that
of course intelligence is not just one
shot but intelligence requires thinking
and thinking is reasoning and maybe
you're doing path planning and maybe
you're doing some simulations in your
mind you're reflecting on your own
answers and so as a
result thinking results in higher
quality answers and we've now discovered
a second scaling law and this is a SCA
scaling law at a time of inference the
longer you think the higher quality
answer you can produce and so that's
where thinking reasoning planning comes
in and the more you compute the higher
quality answer uh you could provide and
so we now have two fundamental scaling
laws that is driving our technology
development first for training and now
for inference the number of foundation
model makers has more than doubled since
the beginning of Hopper there are more
companies that realize that fundamental
intelligence is vital to their company
and that they have to build Foundation
model technology and second the size of
the models have increased by 20 30 40x
the amount of computation necessary to
train these model because of uh the size
of the models but also multimodality
capability um reinforcement learning
capability synthetic data generation
capability the amount of data that we
use to train these models has really
grown tremendously that's one and then
the other reason of course is that
blackwall is also used for generating
tokens at incredible speeds and so
together all of these factors has led to
the demand for black wellbeing
incredibly High okay so so Nvidia in
India uh we have we have a really rich
ecosystem here uh the first thing that
you have to realize is that in order to
build an AI ecosystem in any industry or
in any country you have to start first
with the ecosystem of the infrastructure
and we announced that Yoda that ET T
Communications and our other partners uh
are joining us to build fundamental
Computing infrastructure here in India
and in just one year's time by the end
of this year we will have nearly 20
times more
compute here in India than just a little
over a year ago that's the amount of
infrastructure we're
y so the first part of building an AI
ecosystem is the AI infrastructure just
as the first part of uh infrastructure
for the internet ecosystem was building
the infrastructure of of networking of
course uh the infrastructure of
networking internet consists of the
personal computer cloud and and internet
itself um in the case of AI it starts
with the AI Computing infrastructure the
next part the operating system of AI is
large language models and we've worked
with Partners here in India to build the
Hindi large language model the next
layer is um the application layer above
that and uh working with us to bring uh
AI to to uh the ecosystem of India of
course uh AI native companies that are
creating new applications that are
started that made possible only with AI
and then our Service Partners uh from
from wiipro to infosis to to TCS working
with us to take the AI models and the AI
infrastructure out to the world's
Enterprises now that's Nvidia in India
I'm going to have uh Vel our country
leader
come join me on stage this is a time now
where the large language models and the
fundamental AI capabilities have reached
a level of capabilities we're able to
now create what is called agents large
language models that understand
understand the data that of course is
being presented it could be it could be
streaming data could video data language
model data it could be data of all kinds
the first stage is perception the second
is reasoning about given its
observations uh what is the mission and
what is the task it has to perform in
order to perform that task the agent
would break down that task into steps of
other tasks and uh it would reason about
what it would take and it would connect
with other AI models and so we're going
to have agents that are helping our
employees become super employees these
agents or agentic AI models uh augment
all of our employees to supercharge them
make them more productive um that entire
process we put into essentially an agent
life cycle Suite of libraries and we
call that Nemo our partners are working
with us to integrate these libraries
into their platforms so that they could
enable agents to be created
onboarded deployed improved into a life
cycle of Agents essentially this is a
factory that builds AIS today we have
Computing from Yota which has built the
state-of-the-art infrastructure tatas
are going live E2 e2e has been in
existence giving us exalent Computing
infrastructure for a long long period of
time all this Computing helped us to Le
frog to solve one of India's largest
problem that is a about
communication today the work that we are
doing in iits the work that we are doing
at different organization is all a
result of coming together solving the
critical issue that India Has Not only
was the language getting solved we also
realize very quickly that there are many
mega challenges that India has a Wells
spoken Indian and a healthy Indian
always make a difference and that's why
we have companies who've been working on
health as many of us know it's been
challenging how do we look after our
health but Diagnostics coming from sck
Tuple cure. is really helping us solve
many of these challenges it takes an
entire ecosystem of Partners to be able
to help the world apply AI to help their
employees be more productive and this is
whereas India was focused on it the back
office operations of software the
delivery of software producing software
the next generation of it is going to be
about producing and delivery of
AI and as you know the delivery of
software coding and the delivery of AI
is fundamentally different but
dramatically more
impactful insanely more
exciting and the ability for this
industry for
India to help every single company
around the world to enjoy the benefit of
agents to enjoy the benefits of AIS
across all of their different
functionalities to be able to deploy it
at scale that next generation of AI
needs to understand the physical world
we call it physical AI now here here in
India we've got a really great ecosystem
who is working with us to take this
infrastructure take this ecosystem of
capabilities to help the world build
physical AI systems and you know what
I've really loved is adverb is one of
the largest robotics company they build
Robotics and more importantly they put
it in a digital twin where optimization
takes place they teach the robo all the
inputs that comes out of the physical
world not only is that work taking place
our system in greaters asenta TCS Tech
Mahindra are taking that knowledge not
only into India but also outside India
so do it in India for India and do from
India for
globe start
locally grow globally right right that's
fantastic I want to introduce you to
somebody I met today there's a superstar
in in the audience aay Kumar what I want
to know is what is one thing which um AI
can't copy from humans depending on the
jobs that we do sometimes it could do
20% of our jobs 20% of our work a
thousand times better for some people it
might be able to do 50% of their job a
thousand times better but in no job can
they do all of it every one of us should
apply
AI to automate to become an assistant to
help us with that either 20% 40% or 50%
and so the most important thing the most
important thing for us right now is to
build amazing AIS build safe AIS that's
good engineering discipline good
engineering business a good Engineering
Process methodologies Technologies all
come together so that we could build
safe AIS it's like building a safe
airplane the automation systems with
diversity and redundancy all of the
backup systems make makes it possible
for air travel the airplane to be safe
and air travel to be safe the same ideas
will apply to artificial intelligence it
is our fundamental mission to enable AI
to be realized for the benefits of
society but doing in a way that is
systematically safe and not only do we
make the AI safe we create other AIS to
keep it safe I have another special
guest an industry pioneer
someone someone we can genuinely said
digitalize
India and help build the fabric of the
modern internet India that we know
ladies and gentlemen mesh Ambani the IT
industry of India is world world
renowned for its very large
scale and not just in size but in deep
expertise of computer science very few
countries in the world has this natural
resource this amazing natural resource
called it and computer science expertise
in the last couple of years we've been
working together to upskill and we've
now upskilled about
200,000 it professionals into the world
of AI India has become home right among
all the companies across the world we
are our fastest in growing industry is
global competency centers so we do space
research in India we do pharmaceutical
research in India I'm sure that you're
thinking of building chips in India we
are in our own energy industry we do bio
energy industry all the energy major
shell BP right actually do their
innovation in India so India is fast
becoming a Innovation Hub for the world
in terms of where we are today apart
from the US and China right India has
the best digital connectivity
infrastructure 4G 5G and Broadband in
the world yeah one of the things that
that that uh you you've highlighted is
just the immense amount of Digital Data
that's available um surely at Gio and in
India and this is leads to leads to one
of the things that I want to announce uh
with you uh as you as you know in order
to lead in artificial intelligence you
need to have uh AI model technology that
uh India has you need to have data
massive quantities of data the last
thing you need is uh AI infrastructure
and uh uh we're we're announcing that
that Reliance and Nvidia are partnering
uh to build AI infrastructure here in
India so now you you have the
fundamental ingredients uh AI data and
AI infrastructure uh and you have a
large population of users that
ultimately creates your AI flywheel we
are now ready for big scaleup so we're
building infrastructure right and we
think big so we're building
infrastructure for 1 gwatt which can be
expandable to multiple gwatt at one
location it
is important that we design and build
infrastructure so that to use AI our
customers don't have to change a phone
don't have to change their computers but
they can still get good quality Ai and
we take the burden of putting that
infrastructure together yeah and I think
that is what uh we are counting on you
and us to do The Foundry tools that we
have we are looking forward to a
Development Center where we take core of
your tools and train hundreds of
thousands of developers in India to use
all the Enterprise tools to use the
Omniverse tools so that we can really
apply intelligence in a practical way
and to me this is just the starting of
this intelligence age certainly we would
agree that this is an extraordinary time
for the world and this is an
extraordinary opportunity for India um
to have precisely the conditions to have
such a large population and large
industry of computer
scientists at a time when this industry
the Computing industry is going to
become the intelligence
industry leveraging on everything that
you have leveraging on everything that
you know and your indigenous
Advantage enormous amounts of data a
large population of consumers to drive
that flywheel of intelligence to data
data to intelligence intelligence to
data and have to National will to go do
something about it this is such an
extraordinary time and I am honored and
privileged to be partnered with you to
do this and let's make it a promise
today that we will work together so that
India could take advantage of the
intelligence Revolution that's ahead of
us
